Hello! I am Zonghan Li, a master‚Äòs student studying *Environmental Social Science* at Tsinghua University, supervised by Professor Yi Liu. 

My research interests are environmental impact assessment, human behavior simulation, and climate change mitigation. I am mianly using tools like machine learning, statistical causal inference, large language models, structural equation models, field survey and experiment to solve the research problems.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or wish to collaborate on any related projects. Email: zh-li22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; lzh3603@gmail.com
