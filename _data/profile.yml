    I am Zonghan Li, a PhD student and researcher at the <a href="https://www.feng-ji.org/lab-members" target="_blank">Psychometrics and Responsible AI Lab</a>, University of Toronto, supervised by Dr. <a href="https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/49686-feng-ji" target="_blank">Feng Ji</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research focuses on (1) GenAI for social and behavioral sciences, and (2) environmental and urban systems modeling. Currently, I am investigating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in simulating human attitudes and behaviors, as well as the potential inequalities and biases these systems might introduce. This builds upon my Master‘s work at Tsinghua University, where I conducted a randomized controlled trial leveraging LLMs to deliver personalized interventions that promote pro-environmental behaviors.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received my M.Sc. in Engineering from Tsinghua University, advised by Dr. <a href="https://www.env.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1271/5866.htm" target="_blank">Yi Liu</a>, and collaborated closely with Dr. <a href="https://www.pcs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xlxen/info/1008/1346.htm" target="_blank">Kaiping Peng</a>. I earned my B.Econ. in Applied Economics from China University of Petroleum and worked as a research assistant in the labs of Dr. <a href="https://www.cup.edu.cn/sba/szdwgb/glkxygcxgb/w1/c15e043feb5e41e4bc17cf35127ba4b5.htm" target="_blank">Jianliang Wang</a> and Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yumo-wang-ph-d-28275995" target="_blank">Yumo Wang</a>.
  <p>
    <i class="fa-solid fa-rectangle-ad" style="color: #d60000;"></i> <span style="color: #d60000;">I am looking for collaborators</span>  in (1) envionmental shocks and mental health, (2) LLMs in behavioral simulation and intervention, and (3) environmental and urban systems analysis. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out via email.
