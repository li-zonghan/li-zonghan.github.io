Hello! Thanks for stopping by👋!

I am Zonghan Li, a master’s student studying *Environmental System Analysis* at **Tsinghua University** under the supervision of Professor Yi Liu. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in *Energy Economics* from **China University of Petroleum**. I also collaborate closely with Professor Kaiping Peng (Tsinghua Department of Psychology & Cognitive Sciences) and Dr. Jiang Bian (Microsoft Research Asia). 

My research interests span 👤human behavior simulation, 🤖artificial intellgence, and 🌍environmental system analysis. To address these topics, I mainly use machine learning, statistical causal inference, large language models, structural equation modeling, as well as field surveys and experiments.

Currently, I am developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation platform based on large language models to encourage energy and water conservation behaviors on university campuses. This platform has already helped students save ~20% on electricity and water use in their dormitories, and it has strong official backing from Tsinghua.

I am honored to have been admitted to the **University of Toronto**, starting in September 2025, and to be joining the [Psychometrics and Responsible AI Lab](https://www.feng-ji.org/lab-members) as a PhD student and research assistant.
